# TextBlade-for-Karabiner-Elements
This is a layout based on the TextBlade device from WayTools for the Karabiner-Elements. 

After a recent migration to Sierra I found myself without access to a layout that was based off the TextBlade. It was in the previous version of Karabiner but unfortunately not implemented yet in the new version for Karabiner-Elements. I am greatly in debt to Jack Couch and his work on Crackle Dvorak and Crackle QWERTY. Check it out if you would like other productive keyboard layouts.

This layout is used for the Green Layer(r_command) and some symbols(closebracket). The Select and Edit Modes/w copy and paste have not been implemented yet. 

If you don't happen to know of Karabiner/Karabiner-Elements and are looking for keyboard hacks. May I highly recommend it along with Hammerspoon. 

Go check out the great work to keep it moving forward on the Github.

Or download the latest here

After that replace the karabiner.json in the ~/.config/karabiner with this one and get a partially functioning TextBlade on MacOS.
